# Voxy - An AI Voice Interview Agent (Frontend)

This is the frontend application for **Voxy**, a full-stack project designed to conduct dynamic, conversational voice interviews. It is built with **React**, **Vite**, and **Tailwind CSS**.

This application connects to a secure Spring Boot backend (running separately) to:
* Authenticate users (Recruiters/Candidates) via JWT & Google OAuth2.
* Allow recruiters to create interviews by providing a job description and duration.
* Fetch AI-generated "topics" (the interview agenda) from the backend's Gemini API.
* Conduct real-time, voice-based interviews using the **Vapi.ai** agent, which follows the generated topic-based agenda.

### Backend Repository
**Note:** This is a frontend-only repository. To run this project, you **must** have the corresponding backend server running locally.
* **Backend Link:** [AI-Voice-Interview-Agent--Backend](https://github.com/Aliurooz786/AI-Voice-Interview-Agent--Backend)
